# SVG Generator
  Created by Bethany Proctor 

  ## Description
  This project allows users to quickly create an SVG image with their choice of shape, text, and color. Utilizing the command line, the user only needs to answers a few prompts and then their image will be generated in a new file for their use. The biggest challenge that I ran into during this project was the organization and relations of all the different files, but I think it was a good opportunity for me to practice having clean files and file paths.

  ## Installation
  inquirer jest node

  ## Usage
  To make your own SVG file, first download all of the dependencies. Then, simply type "npm start" in the terminal and answer the prompts pertaining to the shape, text, text color, and background color of your SVG image. To access the image once it has been generated, located the "logo.svg" file.

  ## Credits
  I used the W3 Schools documentation on SVGs in order to create the shapes themselves.Find them <a href="w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp">here</a>.
  Another helpful source for me was the YouTube video "SVG Logo Generator" by Sanjay Chopra.
